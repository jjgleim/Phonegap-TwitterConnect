XCode project that demonstrates Phonegap authentication via Twitter.

This code is based on this [WiseJive blog post](http://www.wisejive.com/2010/11/phonegap-jquery-mobile-twitter-and.html).

I just tidied it, and abstracted out some of the app-specific options.

Also, this is the first time I've put an Xcode project on github, so I'm not sure if it will work out of the box. If nothing else works, the _www_ folder contains the most useful code.
